        We have created a simple Mashup application utilizing the google knowledge graph search API, and the Web Speech API.  Users can either enter their search terms into the text field, or click the mic icon and speak their search terms.  Then pressing the 'search google knowledge graph' button users can call the google knowledge graph search and the first result is displayed.
