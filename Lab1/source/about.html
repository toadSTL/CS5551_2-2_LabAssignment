    <p>
        We have created a simple Mashup application utilizing the google knowledge graph search API, and the Web Speech API.  Users can either enter their search terms into the text field, or click the mic icon and speak their search terms.  Then pressing the 'search google knowledge graph' button users can call the google knowledge graph search and the first result is displayed.

    <p>
       Team 2 will be creating a UMKC parking app which will allow students to check and provide information about the availability of parking spaces in UMKC parking lots.  Initially user feedback will be how the system gets information about the availability of parking, but ultimately we intend to use entrance/exit sensors to collect data about the occupancy of--and hence the availability of parkin in--UMKC parking lots.
